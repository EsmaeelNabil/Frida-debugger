##### How to use
- `runEmulator.sh` to launch an emulator
  - `Android SDK` is required
- `prepareFridaEmulator.sh` to ship `frida server` to the emulator.
  - Has to be done everytime if it's not saved in the emulator in case of restarts.
  - You need to run it again if you couldn't see a `pid` with a message like this `Frida server is running on  with pid 21420.`
  - `ADB` is required

in case you need an updated `Frida-Server` use `tools/fmc` to download it.
```
but it has to be renamed to fridaserver for ./prepareFridaEmulator.sh to work properly.
```
